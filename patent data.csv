1,US9999888,"Specimen container for urine and other liquids 
       ",Robert Ziegler | Alex Stefanowicz,Integrated Lab Solutions Inc,Pro Tech Precision Labs LLC,19-05-2016,19-05-2016,19-06-2018,20,"1. A liquid specimen container for urine and other liquids comprising:
a cup including:
a cylindrical sidewall with an upper edge and a lower edge,
a bottom wall attached to the lower edge, and
the upper edge defining an open end;

a container lid, the lid including:
a central portion with a top surface and a bottom surface, the central portion defining a septum hole formed through the top and bottom surfaces, and
cylindrical sidewalls;

a septum of elastomeric material, the septum including:
a top surface,
a bottom surface,
a depressed portion including an area of minimum thickness, the depressed portion increasing in thickness from the minimum thickness to much thicker elastomeric material, the increase in thickness occurring over a substantial distance along a direction transverse to the thickness, and
a raised portion, including:
a flat central portion extending radially outward from the depressed portion and extending vertically from the top surface of the central portion of the container lid, and
a flat overlapping portion extending radially outward from a top edge of the flat central portion over a portion of the top surface of the central portion of the container lid;

wherein the septum is connected to the container lid so as to completely block the septum hole, and wherein the depressed portion and said area of minimum thickness are shaped and configured to elastically distend to pass an implement through a tear in the area of minimum thickness and to be self-reclosing by returning opposite edges of the tear to a substantially contiguous closed condition after withdrawal of the implement;
a non-porous seal affixed to the bottom surface of the central portion and having a top surface and a bottom surface, wherein the seal covers the bottom surface of the septum and creates a liquid-tight boundary between the septum and the bottom surface of the seal; and
wherein the container lid is adapted to engage the open end of the cup and form a chamber within the cup between the bottom wall and the lid.","

2,US9999999,"Injector for plastic material injection molding apparatus 
       ",Maurizio Bazzo,Inglass SpA,Inglass SpA,10-12-2014,07-12-2015,19-06-2018,2,"1. An injector for a plastic material injection molding apparatus, comprising a nozzle having a hollow terminal having a tip with an outlet end having a cylindrical inner surface, a cylindrical pin-shaped valve axially displaceable along the nozzle and having a distal end, and an electronically controlled actuator arrangement to operate displacement of said pin valve between an advanced fully closed position of the injector, and a retracted position of maximum opening, wherein the pin valve is provided in proximity to said distal end with a reduced diameter cylindrical portion movable through said outlet end of the tip of the nozzle and delimiting therewith an annular passage having a constant cross section, and in that said electronically controlled actuator arrangement is configured to axially position said reduced diameter cylindrical portion of the pin valve, when the latter is set between said fully closed and said maximum opening positions, at intermediate positions so as to selectively vary an axial extension of said annular passage and consequently adjust a pressure drop of the injected plastic material.","

3,US8888888,"Method and a control system for controlling a melting process 
       ",Michael Lundh | Xiaojing Zhang,ABB Research Ltd Switzerland,Hitachi Energy Switzerland AG,18-07-2011,17-01-2014,18-11-2014,9,"1. A method of controlling a melting process in an electric arc furnace for melting a metallic material, wherein the method comprises:
i) receiving measurements of at least one process variable reflecting the melting process,
ii) determining a current state of the melting process based on a model of the melting process, a previous state of the melting process, a previous control input, and the measurements of the at least one process variable,
iii) determining a current process input which minimizes a desired process property, wherein the determining comprises minimizing the desired process property with respect to all allowed values of process inputs and utilizing constraints involving the current state of the melting process and a desired end state of the melting process,
iv) controlling the melting process utilizing the current process input to control an electromagnetic stirrer, and
v) repeating steps i) to iv) until the desired end state of the melting process has been obtained.","
